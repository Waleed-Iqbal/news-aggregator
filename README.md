### Notes

- Unknown url will redirect to the home page

## Challenge

- APIs are a hassle
- APIs fail with message like "You have made too many requests recently. Developer accounts are limited to 100 requests over a 24 hour period (50 requests available every 12 hours). Please upgrade to a paid plan if you need more requests."
- Cannot install docker as I have restrictions on my machine
